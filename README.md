# bibx
Open-source and free bibliography generator similar to easybib.com. No ads or tracking.

To use, go to [bibx.io](bibx.io). 

It's a little early but I really like bun so you should also have that installed (bun.sh)

To install this project locally, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xavierclarkvt/bibx.git
cd bibx; bun install;
```

And to start, run:
```bash
bun run dev;
```
